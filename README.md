# Project 6: Around the USA

### Overview

- Intro (3)
- Figma (3)
- Images (3)
- Javascript (4)
- Element Cloning (Moving and Removing Elements) (5)
- DOM Related Methods Return Array-Like Collections
  - These Collections are querySelectorAll, Array.from() (5)

**Descriptions**

This project is a portion of the continuing project called Around the U.S. (started in Sprint3)

In Sprint3, I created a responsive layout from the design specs in Figma using grids and adding buttons.

1. Working with fonts and text in Figma
2. Working with images in Figma
3. Working with other users
4. Saving a Figma file
5. Deploy your project to GitHub Pages
6. Publish your project on GitHub Pages for the whole world to see.

In Sprint4 I utilized Javascript (script.js) to make the project interactive:

1. stage 1 - creating an array for initial cards for the 6 imgs and links
2. stage 2 - creating a modal box in the CSS
3. stage 3 - using the DOM to create buttons within About Me, Save, Close integrated with HTML and CSS and JS
4. stage 4 - adding final functionality to the modal box and making the 6 cards render from the array

In Sprint5, I added on more elements to the previous project. The elements I added includes a new modal for adding new cards to display, an image popup that toggles on mouse-click, a like button that interacts with mouse-clicks and a delete icon that removes cards fromthe page.

1. Rendered Cards
2. Form for Adding a Card
3. Adding a Card (New Place)
4. Inserting Like Button (heart icon)
5. Inserting Trash Icon for Deleting a Card
6. Opening a Picture Modal
7. Smooth Modal Opening and Closing

In Sprint6, I started to debug JS using console.log() to validate changes made on the console. Also I incorporated the use of Objects, Event Handlers, Forms, & Form Validation.

1. Objects
   1a. intro to objects
   1b. creating objects and adding properties
   1c. accessing properties
   1d. operators (delete, in)
   1e. iterating over properties
   1f. pass by reference
   1g. comparing objects
   1h. copying objects
   a. shallow copying
   b. deep copying
   1i. Objects as Arrays
   1j. Objects as Functions
2. Event Handling
   2a. intro
   2b. keyboard events
   2c. properties of Keyboard Event Objects KEOs
   2d. properties of Mouse Event Object MEOs
   2e. Removing Event Listener
   2f. Preventing a Browsers Default Behavior
   evt.preventDefault();
   2g. Event Bubbling and Delegation
   2h. extra-preventing bubbling
   2i. extra-HTML event attributes
   2j. resources
3. Forms
   3a. intro
   3b. accessing forms using JS
   3c. submitting forms
   3d. accessing form elements
   3e. referring to Form elements values
   3f. The Change and Input elements
   3g. the Reset and Submit Methods
4. Form Validation
   4a. intro
   4b. browser build-in form validation
   4c. JS form validation
   4d. connecting JS validation to the DOM
   4e. validation of several fields and forms
   4f. interaction with other DOM elements
5. Debugging in Javascript
   console.log

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes using media queries.

**Images**

- retrieved the images from the sprint3 platform
- or the images could be directly exported from Figma is another method
- optimized them so the projects load faster
