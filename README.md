**Descriptions**

This project is the third stage in a new project called Around the U.S.

In Sprint3, I created a responsive layout from the design specs in Figma using grids and adding buttons.

In Sprint4 I utilized Javascript (script.js) to make the project interactive
stage 1 - creating an array for initial cards for the 6 imgs and links

Sprint4:

1. Data Types and Variables
2. Conditionals and Loops
3. Data Structures, Arrays, and Objects
4. Functions
5. Basics of the DOM
6. Debugging
7. Export GIT

Sprint3:

1. working with design specs
2. design in a world of ever-changing devices
3. grid layout
4. developing interfaces for different devices
5. intermediate Git

**Images**

- retrieved the images from the sprint3 platform
- or the images could be directly exported from Figma is another method
- optimized them so the projects load faster
