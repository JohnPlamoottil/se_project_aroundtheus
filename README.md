**Descriptions**

This project is a portion of the continuing project called Around the U.S. (started in Sprint3)

In Sprint3, I created a responsive layout from the design specs in Figma using grids and adding buttons.

1. Working with fonts and text in Figma
2. Working with images in Figma
3. Working with other users
4. Saving a Figma file
5. Deploy your project to GitHub Pages
6. Publish your project on GitHub Pages for the whole world to see.

In Sprint4 I utilized Javascript (script.js) to make the project interactive:

1. stage 1 - creating an array for initial cards for the 6 imgs and links
2. stage 2 - creating a modal box in the CSS
3. stage 3 - using the DOM to create buttons within About Me, Save, Close integrated with HTML and CSS and JS
4. stage 4 - adding final functionality to the modal box and making the 6 cards render from the array

In Sprint5, I added on more elements to the previous project. The elements I added includes a new modal for adding new cards to display, an image popup that toggles on mouse-click, a like button that interacts with mouse-clicks and a delete icon that removes cards fromthe page.

1. Rendered Cards
2. Form for Adding a Card
3. Adding a Card (New Place)
4. Inserting Like Button (heart icon)
5. Inserting Trash Icon for Deleting a Card
6. Opening a Picture Modal
7. Smooth Modal Opening and Closing

In Sprint6, I started to debug JS using console.log() to validate changes made on the console. Also I incorporated the use of Objects, Event Handlers, Forms, & Form Validation.

1. Objects
   1. intro to objects
   2. creating objects and adding properties
   3. accessing properties
   4. operators (delete, in)
   5. iterating over properties
   6. pass by reference
   7. comparing objects
   8. copying objects
   9. shallow copying
   10. deep copying
   11. Objects as Arrays
   12. Objects as Functions
2. Event Handling
   1. intro
   2. keyboard events
   3. properties of Keyboard Event Objects KEOs
   4. properties of Mouse Event Object MEOs
   5. Removing Event Listener
   6. Preventing a Browsers Default Behavior - evt.preventDefault();
   7. Event Bubbling and Delegation
   8. extra-preventing bubbling
   9. extra-HTML event attributes
   10. resources
3. Forms
   1. intro
   2. accessing forms using JS
   3. submitting forms
   4. accessing form elements
   5. referring to Form elements values
   6. The Change and Input elements
   7. the Reset and Submit Methods
4. Form Validation
   1. intro
   2. browser build-in form validation
   3. JS form validation
   4. connecting JS validation to the DOM
   5. validation of several fields and forms
   6. interaction with other DOM elements
5. Debugging in Javascript
   1. console.log

In Sprint7, the purpose is to change javascript classes as Max pointed out in his tutorial. The classes to focus on are card.js and FormValidator.js with text and images in the scripts folder.

1. Intro to Object Oriented Programming OOP
   1. program - a set of interacting objects that make up a single structure
   2. object - store data and have methods enabling that data to be passed from one obj to another
   3. encapsulation -
   4. inheritance -
   5. polymorphism -
   6. properties - key-value pairs
   7. method - the value is a function
      8
2. Interfaces in OOP
3. Intro to Modular Javascript

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes using media queries.

**Images**

- retrieved the images from the sprint3 platform
- or the images could be directly exported from Figma is another method
- optimized them so the projects load faster
